            "summary": "Poor data quality not only leads to a degraded machine learning model but also requires a lot of laborious manual effort to investigate and refill. Uber writes about its Unified Data Quality Platform(UDQ) that automatically detects data quality issues. The approach to generate automatic test cases from the past learning and metadata fields emphasis the more significant role of data lineage and metadata-driven workflow.",

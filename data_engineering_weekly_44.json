            "summary": "Data mesh is a widely discussed data engineering principle, and there were many exciting discussions around it. The concept of \"data as a product\" compelling, and many successful internet companies adopted it in the past with great success. The debate on how the data mesh principle encapsulates the data as a product & decentralized ownership is an exciting space to watch. The author shared some insightful views on data mesh principles.",

            "summary": "Modern business operations increasingly depend on data to derive their business. As the data takes the central role in the business operation, the number of stakeholders interacting with the data is more diverse than ever. In this increasingly diverse data world, metadata holds the key to the elusive promised land. Is it a time to think about metadata lake? The blog narrates the role of metadata lake in the modern data stack.",

Paradoxically, while building ML models are often highly prioritized, the work related to data is often the least prioritized aspect. The blog summarizes the recent ACM paper Everyone wants to do the model work, not the data work: Data Cascades in High-Stakes AI, and discuss how to address the data cascading effects.",

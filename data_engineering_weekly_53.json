The growth of modern data engineering tooling focus on a specific part of data engineering leads to data practitioners' isolated and inconsistent experience. An integrated data platform experience that can connect the modern and past data tools greatly accelerates data-driven culture.",

            "summary": "There are several advantages of adopting a decentralized schema-on-read data lake approach. However, it can leads to inconsistency in the naming of the schema. A \"server\" column can be named as \"Machine\" or \"Host\" or \"instance\" in other tables. Finding column relationships is a complex task historically solved by sampling the data or finding the unique value matching. Microsoft lab writes an exciting paper that uses SQL query logs to find the relationship.",

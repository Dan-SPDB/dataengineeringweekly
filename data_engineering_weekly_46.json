            "summary": "The structured event stream processing brings challenges to data modeling. Often the event structure ends up a complex nested structure, and the consumers need to process only a subset of events most of the time. Serialization & deserialization is compute-intensive for the downstream consumers. Pinterest writes an existing blog on how it implemented partial deserialization on thrift to process the events efficiently.",

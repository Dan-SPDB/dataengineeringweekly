            "summary": "Last week we saw  Jamie Brandon's manifesto against SQL. SQL's problems boil down to its inexpressiveness, incompressibility, and non-porousness. Pedram Navid writes a well-thought article for SQL, saying it is not a concern in most cases, and when it comes to composability, tools like dbt have helped bridge that gap bringing the power of jinja templating to SQL. The author raised some valid questions: all these arguments against SQL result from an almost class divide between \"Software Engineering\" and \"Data People.\"?",
